Hi, I am Owaish, Imaging Scientist at Aira Matrix. I develop AI-based solution for life sciences. My key skills are segmentation, object detection, classification, image processing. 

<!-- For the last 1 years I have been associated with Aira Matrix, and working on mainly two projects. 
Prostate Gleason Grading: Prostate cancer is the second deadliest cancer in men, seriously affecting 
people’s life and health. Normal Prostate tissue consists of stroma and regularly arranged glands. 
However, cancer tissue has epithelial cells that will replicate and destroy the regular arrangement of 
glandular units. The Gleason Grading is one of the most reliable method to quantify the invasiveness
prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is divided into 5 categories and Gleason grading is sum of tumor’s
major and minor component (>5%). These patterns have been manually assigned by pathologists. This 
process is very time consuming and affected by inter and intra observer variability. The project aim is to 
develop an automated Gleason grading system that will help pathologists in saving time and can 
overcome inter and intra observer variability to provide better diagnosis. I developed a grade 
segmentation model which outperform the standard DeeplabV3 plus architecture. I re-design the 
DeeplabV3 plus to make it faster and memory efficient. I replaced the ASSP module with efficient eASSP 
module which is based on two principles. Cascading atrous convolution which increases the receptive 
field of view and can efficiently aggregate dense multiscale features and while the bottleneck structure 
makes the eASSP module memory efficient and results in reducing the 87.87% learning parameters and 
89% FLOPS in comparison with ASSP. The last two decoder layer are also replaced by bottle neck 
structure to further enhance memory efficiency and fast inferencing. I was successfully able to increase 
the performance by 4.22 %.

The other project I am working on is to identify the Organs present in a Whole Slide Image 
(WSI). Histopathological examination of animal tissue by pathologist forms a crucial part of preclinical 
drug toxicology. Automated identification of animal anatomy is the first prerequisite for developing 
analytical solution in medical images. However, spatial complexity and variability of anatomy makes the 
classification more challenging. In order to overcome these problems, we come up with an Ensemble of 
low and high magnification classifiers. A low magnification classifier will only learn shape based features
to identify the anatomy of an object in a WSI, while a high magnification classifier will only learn texture 
and morphology from the patches of an anatomy. I developed inference pipeline that will combines the 
predictions from two classifiers. The inference script read a WSI and generates a color image at high 
magnification, in order to separate the anatomical objects a series of image processing based 
techniques are used to create instances for each anatomical object. Later these instances are used to 
create sections for low magnification classifier and to generate a batch of small patches for high 
magnification classifier. -->
